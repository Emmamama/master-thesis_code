====================code for master thesis=======================
1. SSTS folder is for Subsequence Time series Clustering Algorithm.
   Run main.m.  
   Subseqence Extranction.m, MKMotif.m and SubsequenceMatching.m are used to find time series subsequence motifs. 
   UpdateCluster.m, CreateCluster.m and MergeCluster.m are sub-algorithm for clustering algorithm.

2. The rest code are for Whole time series analyze.
   MK.m and MK_Test.m are for trend test of dataset.
   Data_Extraction.m, Character_Extraction.m, clustering, clustering_draw, Mass_Produce.m are code of Feature based hierarchical clustering. 
   Normal_Mass_Prodeuce.m is normal hierarchical clustering code.
   Criterion.m is used to evaluate these two algorithms.
